# python-challenge2

In this project, I created a Python script analysing the financial records of a company and calculating each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My final script allowed me to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results. These can be found in the PyBank folder.

I created a second Python script analysing the votes in a small rural town and calculating the following values:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

My final script allowed me to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results. These can be found in the PyPoll folder.
